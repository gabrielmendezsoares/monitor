# 🖥️ Monitor

## 📋 Overview

Monitor is a modular observability system designed to track the health and performance of applications through their exposed endpoints. It continuously collects, analyzes, and formats status data from multiple services, offering flexible reporting options that suit different operational needs.

The system supports multiple output channels, including WhatsApp notifications, JSON API responses, and custom report formats. Its architecture is built for adaptability — whether running standalone or integrated into broader monitoring pipelines, Monitor provides a reliable, centralized view of system health across environments.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Continuously monitor application health endpoints
- Group and format data for flexible consumption
- Deliver reports via various channels (e.g., WhatsApp, HTTP endpoints)
- Enable integration with third-party systems and dashboards
- Provide visibility into system uptime, latency, and failures
